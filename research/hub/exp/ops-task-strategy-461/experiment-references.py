"""Direction 2, experiment A: does a longer task statement stay resolvable?

A short task says little; a detailed one names paths, artifacts and versions.
Every named path is a promise the executor will try to follow. This experiment
measures how often that promise holds, resolving each reference against the Hub
tree **as it stood on the day the task was written** (not against today's tree,
which several migrations have since reshaped).

Metrics per task statement:
    refs_total        distinct repository paths named in the issue body
    refs_unresolved   those that did not exist at issue creation time
    unresolved_rate   refs_unresolved / refs_total

Only `hybrid-Intelligence-lab` is measured: it is the repository whose full
history is available locally, and resolving references against a remote tree per
issue would cost one API call per path. This limit is stated in the output.

Usage:
    python3 experiment-references.py [--repo-root PATH]
