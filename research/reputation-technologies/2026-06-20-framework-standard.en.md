# GRA Framework Standard — Draft (International Format)

> Draft standard for the **GRA reputation-technology framework**, structured to
> **ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010** (architecture description) and anchored to **ISO/IEC 42001** (AI
> management). This is a **research proposal for a standard**, not a ratified standard and not an
> implementation. It accompanies the main report
> [2026-06-20-founders-vision-and-framework.ru.md](2026-06-20-founders-vision-and-framework.ru.md) and the
> [white paper](2026-06-20-white-paper.en.md). Terminology is in the
> [glossary](2026-06-20-glossary.ru-en.md).

**GRA** — *Gravitational & Magnetic Reputation Architecture* (public slogan: *Global Reputation
Agreement*). Curator: Ivan Gulienko. License: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.

## 0. Status of this document

This draft consolidates the founder's three-level naming (`0_2-standard.txt`) and the team-Q/team-G
dialogues into a single, internationally legible standard skeleton. It supersedes the fragmented
naming and the 2011 edition reference of the source material (see normative references). It is
offered for community review on the **de-facto-standard** track (see roadmap in the main report,
Part XI), not yet submitted to a formal standards body.

## 1. Scope

### 1.1 Purpose

This standard specifies how to **describe, instantiate, and validate** a reputation system as a
governed, measurable, manageable graph — the **information-reputation field** — across levels from
**individual** to **brand**, **company**, and **state**, and how **AI** is applied to model, manage,
predict, and automate within it.

### 1.2 Field of application

In scope: ontology, methodology (Gravity + Magnetism), data model, AI methodology, domain
adaptation, validation, governance/ethics. Out of scope: any specific commercial implementation,
proprietary scoring weights, or a ratified conformance-certification scheme (future work).

### 1.3 Conformance

A description **conforms** to this standard if it provides every normative element in §6
(Architecture Description Elements) and complies with the governance clauses in §8. Conformance is
**self-declared** at this draft stage; third-party conformance assessment is reserved for a future
edition.

## 2. Normative references

| Reference | Edition | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 | **2022** | Primary — architecture description (stakeholders, concerns, viewpoints, views). *Corrects the source's 2011 citation.* |
| ISO/IEC 42001 | **2023** | AI management system — governs every AI function in §7. *Key reference added vs. source.* |
| W3C RDF 1.1; OWL 2; SKOS; PROV-O | current | Ontology, controlled vocabulary, provenance |
| TOGAF Standard (ADM) | 10th | Iterative development & validation cycle (§9) |
| IMRaD | — | Structure of supporting scientific publications |
| GOST R 7.0.5 | 2008 | Bibliographic citation for Russian-language outputs |
| ISO 20671-1; ISO 10668 | 2021; 2010 | Brand evaluation (adjacent measurement) |
| ISO 31000; 37000; 26000; 30401; 22301 | current | Risk; governance; social responsibility; knowledge; continuity |
| GRI Standards; SASB/ISSB | current | Disclosure analogues for transparent methodology |
| EU AI Act (Reg. 2024/1689); OECD AI Principles; NIST AI RMF | current | AI governance, transparency, prohibited practices |

## 3. Terms and definitions

The normative vocabulary is maintained in the [glossary](2026-06-20-glossary.ru-en.md). Core terms:

- **Reputation** — the dynamic state of the information-reputation field; not a label but a graph
  configuration. «Reputation lives not in the customer's head, but in the links between customers.»
- **Information-reputation field** — a weighted, directed graph of nodes and edges that **contains
  and leads the market** (lag 30–180 days).
- **Node (subject/object)** — an entity at any level (individual…state) with a **mass** and an
  **Identity–Capability–Impact** triad.
- **Edge (development edge)** — a relation with type, weight, **polarity** (+1/0/−1), distance, and
  trust-transfer risk.
- **Mass** — influence/resource/reputation capital.
- **Distance** — inverse of trust.
- **Polarity** — sign of an edge: +1 attraction, 0 neutral, −1 repulsion; time-dependent.
- **Gravity / Magnetism** — external structural attraction (mass/distance²) / internal
  polarity-setting contour.
- **Trust Equity** — accumulated positive reputation capital.

## 4. Naming (normative)

The framework is named **GRA = Gravitational & Magnetic Reputation Architecture**. The public-facing
slogan **Global Reputation Agreement** MAY be used in marketing. The earlier methodological label
"Gravity–Resonance Architecture" and the scientific label "GRANIT" are **deprecated** in favour of
the single backronym to avoid brand fragmentation and to resolve the *Resonance vs. Magnetism*
inconsistency (Magnetism/polarity is the operational term). Rationale and trade-offs: main report §8.1.

## 5. Conceptual model (architecture rationale)

### 5.1 Axioms

1. Reputation is **measurable, modelable, manageable**.
2. Its substrate is **relations** (a graph), not individual minds.
3. The field **leads** the market; managing the field is a leading indicator of revenue.
4. AI is the **instrument** that makes modelling and management tractable.

### 5.2 Interaction model

$$ F(t) = \frac{Mass_A \times Mass_B}{Distance^2} \times Polarity(t) $$

Grounded in the Gravity Model of Trade (Tinbergen, 1962), Force Field Analysis (Lewin, 1947), and
the ABI trust model (Mayer–Davis–Schoorman, 1995). The "force field" is an **operational metaphor**
over graph mathematics and trust theory; its rigorous home is **sociophysics** (Castellano et al.,
2009) — this disclaimer is **normative** to prevent "aggregate-confusion" misuse.

### 5.3 Control contours

Internal contour (Magnetism, 80–100% control: identity, capabilities, processes, resources) /
External contour (Gravity, 0–50% influence: stakeholders/influence nodes, events, media, regulators)
/ Environment (macro-trends, 0% control).

## 6. Architecture description elements (normative checklist)

A conforming description SHALL provide:

1. **Passport** — name, version, status, curator, license, changelog.
2. **Stakeholders & concerns** — researchers, educators, practitioners, partners, regulators (ISO 42010 §5.3).
3. **Ontology** — RDF/SKOS vocabulary, taxonomy, semantic network, extension principles.
4. **Methodology viewpoint** — gravity/magnetism, contours, Identity–Capability–Impact triad, control cycles (Governance→Reputation→Action; PDCA + OODA).
5. **Data model viewpoint** — node schema, edge schema, serialization (Edge List / RDF / GraphML), data-quality requirements.
6. **AI methodology viewpoint** — model/manage/predict/automate functions mapped to NLP/CV/Predictive/Simulation/Agent-based, each governed per §8.
7. **Domain adaptation** — SME, corporation, government/GR, NGO, personal brand, education.
8. **Validation & evolution** — TOGAF-ADM cycle, pilots, metrics, versioning, risks.
9. **Governance & ethics** — §8.
10. **References** — normative + scientific + tooling.

## 7. AI methodology (normative requirements)

| Function | Required AI capability | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Model | Entity/relation extraction (NLP), graph construction | RDF triples |
| Manage | Recommendation / agentic action on edges | Action proposals (24–48h rule) |
| Predict | Time-series, agent-based simulation | Cascade forecasts, field→market lead |
| Automate | RPA + LLM pipelines, no-code for SME | Monitoring → labeling → visualization → alerts |
| Perceive | Sentiment (polarity), computer vision | Edge polarity, visual signals |

Every AI function SHALL be operated under an AI management system conforming to **ISO/IEC 42001**
and SHALL comply with **EU AI Act** transparency and prohibited-practice provisions. Manipulative
or deceptive reputation interventions ("Black" class, §8.2) are **non-conforming**.

## 8. Governance and ethics (normative)

### 8.1 Methodological transparency

To avoid "aggregate confusion" (ESG-style rating divergence), any published reputation score SHALL
ship with an **open, reproducible, graph-auditable** methodology. Closed-weight scoring without
published methodology is **non-conforming**.

### 8.2 Ethical classification

| Class | Meaning | Conformance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| White | transparent strengthening of real reputation | conforming |
| Grey | presentation optimization without deception (SEO/GEO, timing) | conforming **with disclosure** |
| Black | manipulation, fabrication (fake reviews, astroturfing) | **non-conforming** (prohibited) |

### 8.3 Data protection

Cross-level graphs containing personal nodes SHALL undergo a **DPIA** and comply with applicable
law (GDPR / 152-FZ) before any public release.

## 9. Validation and evolution (TOGAF ADM)

MVP → Pilot (3–5 calibration pilots for mass/distance) → Scale (graph tooling, AI pipeline, GRA
Index v0) → Ecosystem (separate repository, international contributors, annual published ranking).
Each cycle feeds back to the axioms (§5.1). Versioning follows semantic `MAJOR.MINOR[.PATCH]`.

*Editorial note.* This draft updates two premises of the source `0_2-standard.txt`: (a) ISO/IEC/IEEE
42010 is cited at its **2022** edition (the source cited 2011); (b) **ISO/IEC 42001:2023** is added as
a normative AI-governance reference (absent in the source). Both changes are required for an
internationally credible 2026 standard.
