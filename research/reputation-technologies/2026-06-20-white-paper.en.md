## Abstract

Reputation is usually treated either as a **survey score** (perception indices) or as an
**operational dashboard** (online-reputation management). Neither treats it as what it structurally
is: a **measurable, manageable graph** of relations that spans levels from the individual to the
nation-state and that **leads** market outcomes. **GRA — Gravitational & Magnetic Reputation
Architecture** — formalizes reputation as the **information-reputation field**, a weighted directed
graph in which the force of any relation is `F = (Mass_A × Mass_B) / Distance² × Polarity`. A review
of fifteen leading international projects shows an unoccupied **white space**: no incumbent is
simultaneously **prescriptive**, **graph-native**, **cross-level**, and an **open standard**. This
paper presents the model, the evidence, and a standardization and ecosystem roadmap.

## 1. The problem

Organizations and individuals manage reputation with fragmented tools: listening platforms tell them
*what is being said*, indices tell them *how they rank*, and SEO/entity tools tell them *what
machines believe*. None of these tells them, in one model, **why** reputation moves, **which
relations** drive it, and **what to do next** — across levels and in an auditable, portable way.
Three structural gaps recur:

1. **Perception vs. structure.** Survey indices (RepTrak, Edelman, Anholt-Ipsos NBI) measure
   *perception* but do not expose the *relational structure* that produces it.
2. **Description vs. prescription.** Listening suites describe sentiment; they rarely prescribe a
   causal, testable intervention on a specific relationship.
3. **Silos vs. cross-level continuity.** A person, a brand, a company, and a state are scored by
   different vendors with incompatible methods — yet reputation propagates *across* these levels.

## 2. The founder's insight, formalized

The founder's vision — cleaned of its educational-course wrapping — rests on three axioms: reputation
is **measurable, modelable, manageable**; its substrate is **relations** («reputation lives not in
the customer's head, but in the links between customers»); and **AI** is the instrument that makes
modelling and management tractable. GRA turns these into an operational model.

### 2.1 The field

The **information-reputation field** is a weighted directed graph `G = (V, E)`. Nodes `V` are
subjects/objects at any level; edges `E` are **development edges** carrying type, weight, distance,
trust-transfer risk, and a **polarity** sign. The field **contains** the market and **leads** it by
roughly **30–180 days**, which is what makes reputation a *leading indicator* of revenue
(`Reputation → Trust → ↓CAC → ↑LTV → Profit`).

### 2.2 The force law (an operational metaphor)

```
F(t) = ( Mass_A × Mass_B ) / Distance(t)²  ×  Polarity(t)
```

- **Mass** — influence/resource/reputation capital (revenue, share, authority, reach).
- **Distance** — inverse of trust (closer = more trusted = stronger pull).
- **Polarity ∈ {+1, 0, −1}** — attraction / neutral / repulsion; time-dependent (events flip signs).

This unifies the **Gravity Model of Trade** (Tinbergen, 1962) with **Force Field Analysis** (Lewin,
1947) and signs edges via the **ABI trust model** (Mayer–Davis–Schoorman, 1995). We state plainly:
the "force field" is a **metaphor** over graph mathematics; its rigorous scientific home is
**sociophysics** (Castellano, Fortunato & Loreto, 2009). This honesty is a feature — it is what keeps
a published score auditable rather than mystical.

### 2.3 Contours and the node triad

Management splits into an **internal contour** (Magnetism — identity, capabilities, processes,
resources; 80–100% controllable), an **external contour** (Gravity — stakeholders, events, media,
regulators; 0–50% influenceable), and the **environment** (macro-trends; uncontrollable). Every node
carries an **Identity–Capability–Impact** triad — a cross-level "passport" with analogues at Stanford
GSB, the US Army's *Be-Know-Do*, and INSEAD's *Character-Competence-Contribution*.

## 3. Evidence from the field: fifteen projects, one white space

We reviewed fifteen leading projects across eight categories: ORM/RXM platforms (Reputation, Birdeye,
Yext), social/media intelligence (Brandwatch, Meltwater, Talkwalker, Sprinklr), perception indices
(RepTrak, Edelman Trust Barometer, Harris-Fombrun RQ), AI/entity reputation (Kalicube, Google
Knowledge Graph + E-E-A-T), ESG (MSCI), web3 reputation (Gitcoin/Human Passport), and nation branding
(Anholt-Ipsos NBI). Mapped on two axes — *descriptive↔prescriptive* and *survey↔graph* — they cluster
into recognizable quadrants but leave one cell empty.

**The white space:** no incumbent is at once **prescriptive/engineering**, **graph-native**,
**cross-level (individual→nation)**, and an **open standard**. The closest fragments each miss one
dimension: Kalicube is prescriptive and graph-based but proprietary and brand-level; OpenRank/web3 is
open and graph-native but limited to individuals; RepTrak/Edelman/Anholt own legitimacy but are
survey-based and descriptive. That empty cell is GRA's position.

Two lessons transfer directly. First, the **strongest go-to-market in the category is the "annual
published ranking" flywheel** — Edelman at Davos, the Global RepTrak 100, the NBI — which manufactures
earned media on a schedule, makes the publisher the category's "scorekeeper", and turns ranked
entities into a sales funnel. Second, the **deepest risk is "aggregate confusion"** — ESG ratings
correlate only 0.38–0.71 across providers; any opaque score inherits that critique. GRA's answer is
an **open, reproducible, graph-auditable** methodology.

## 4. The GRA framework

GRA is layered: **philosophy/axioms → ontology (RDF/SKOS) → methodology (gravity/magnetism) → data
model (Edge List / RDF / GraphML) → tooling + AI → domain adaptation → validation (TOGAF ADM)**.
The data model meets users where they are: an **Edge List in a spreadsheet** is the recommended SME
entry point, while **RDF triples (Subject-Predicate-Object)** provide the interoperable, AI-ready
backbone. A business is modeled as a **sub-graph** (legal entity ← owner → employees) with a
cross-role trust-transfer coefficient `α ∈ [0,1]` and explicit **Key-Man-Risk** detection.

AI spans four functions — **model** (extract a graph from text), **manage** (recommend/act on edges),
**predict** (simulate cascades; lead the market), **automate** (no-code pipelines) — each operated
under an **ISO/IEC 42001** AI-management system and **EU AI Act** transparency rules. Interventions
are ethically classified **White / Grey / Black**; the Black class (fabrication, astroturfing) is
prohibited.

## 5. Standardization

GRA is structured to **ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022** (architecture description) and anchored to
**ISO/IEC 42001:2023** (AI management) — the latter being the key reference absent from the founder's
source documents. The recommended path to recognition is **de-facto first** (in the manner of
Schema.org, OpenAPI, NIST CSF, and FAIR): publish an open v1.0 standard plus glossary, build a
contributor community and an annual index, then approach a formal body (ISO PAS or a W3C Community
Group). The trade-off is explicit: de-facto is faster and community-building but lacks an ISO seal;
the formal route confers legitimacy but costs years and committee membership.

## 6. Go-to-market: own the standard and the index

The most defensible commercial position in this category is to **own a standard or an index**, not to
sell another dashboard. GRA should therefore (a) publish the open standard as marketing-grade IP,
(b) launch an **annual, cross-level GRA Index** to become the "scorekeeper" of a space no incumbent
covers end-to-end, and (c) monetize through **advisory and certification** layered on the open core.
Thought-leadership and academic legitimacy compound the flywheel; the principal risk to manage is
**Key-Man-Risk** around a single founder-evangelist (the Kalicube pattern).

## 7. Ecosystem and repository

GRA should live in a **separate repository** — the `reputation-engineering` spoke already reserved in
the Hub ecosystem research — inheriting the Hub's governance (frontmatter standard, validators,
research profile, AI-governance baseline) via the spoke template, and implementing the
EvidenceObject / ReputationClaim / ScoringPolicy / ReputationScore / AppealRecord object model
sketched there. Public-facing publication (the annual index, the standard) can surface through the
ecosystem's public portal. This keeps the framework's implementation **out of the Hub** (per the
issue's constraint) while binding it into the ecosystem's shared governance.

## 8. Roadmap

**Framework (TOGAF ADM):** MVP (ontology + force law + Edge List + one SME case) → Pilot (3–5
calibration pilots) → Scale (graph tooling, AI pipeline, GRA Index v0) → Ecosystem (separate repo,
international contributors, annual ranking). **Standardization:** open v1.0 (0–6 mo) → GRA Index v1
and earned media (6–12 mo) → contributor community + RFC process + IMRaD publications (12–24 mo) →
ISO/IEC PAS or W3C CG submission aligned with 42001/42010 (24–36 mo).

## 9. Conclusion

GRA reframes reputation from a score you *receive* to a field you *engineer* — measurable, auditable,
and continuous from the individual to the state. The international landscape confirms the opportunity:
the prescriptive, graph-native, cross-level, open-standard cell is empty. By owning an open standard
and an annual index, and by binding AI under credible governance, GRA can become the **de-facto
standard for reputation engineering**.
